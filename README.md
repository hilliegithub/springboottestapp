# About

This is a small Java microservices application developed as a hands-on exercise, based on a practical example from [Learn Microservices with Spring Boot](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/learn-microservices-v2/) by Moisés Macerio García. It explores microservices architecture using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and related projects, with Consul for service discovery. While the core design follows the book's example, this project served as a learning experience, and I have made some modifications along the way.
