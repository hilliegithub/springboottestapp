Product: Nueron-cercise

Purpose: Web application to encourage users to excercise their brain everyday. Basically gamifying multiplication guesses to exercise math skills.

User Story 1
As a user of the application, I want to solve a random multiplication problem using mental calculation so I can excercise my brain.

Subtask for this user story:
1. Create a basic service with the business logic
2. Create a basic API to access this service (REST API)
3. Create a basic web page to ask the users to solve the calc.



Application Services
Based on requirements we need:
1. A way to generate mid-complexity mutiplication problems.
2. Functinality to check if attempt is correct or not.

TDD for business logic:
1. Write basic interface to generate random challenges.


Presentation Layer
Using the requirements to design REST APIs to expose:
1. An interface to get the a random, mid complex multipl..
2. Endpoint to send guess for multiplication  for given alias

GET /challenges/random -> returns radom generated challenge
POST /attempts/ -> endpoint to send attempts to solve challenge


User Story 2
As a user of the application, I want to have access to my last attempts so I can see if I'm improving my brain skills over time.

Subtask for this user story:
1. Store all the user attempts and have a way to query them per user.
2. Expose a new REST endpoint to get the latest attempt for a given user.
3. Create a new service (Business Logic) to retrieve those attempts.
4. Show the attempts' history to the users on the web page after they send a new one.


User Story 3
As a user of the application, I want to be motivated to keep solving challenges every day and not abandon it after a while. This way, I keep excercising my brain and improving over time.
